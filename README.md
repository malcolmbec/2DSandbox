# 2DSandbox
A 2D Unity project for me to mess around with using free assets from the Unity Store.  
Created 2020/1/18 using Unity Version 2019.2.18f1.

# Scenes
- Platformer: simple 2D platformer with some coin pick up objects

# Ideas Notepad
- Catch'Em: minigame where player chases agents that are continuously running away from them 
- Boomerang: space invaders/pong hybrid, limited ammunition bounces back and can be reused 
- Townsfolk: role-play typical support NPC in an adventure RPG: Merchant or Healer
