# 2DSandbox
A 2D Unity project for me to mess around with using free assets from the Unity Store.  
Created 2020/1/18 using Unity Version 2019.2.18f1.

# Ideas Notepad
- Catch'Em: minigame where player chases agents that are continuously running away from them 
  - goal: agent-based AI and path navigation
  - expand: agent speeds and patterns, special obstacles for player and/or agents
- Boomerang: space invaders/pong hybrid, limited ammunition bounces back and can be reused 
  - goal: collision systems (and simple PCG?)
- Townsfolk: role-play typical support NPC in an adventure RPG: Merchant or Healer
  - goal: inventory system, dialogue system, RNG/loot table, skills tree
